          <h1>French Pastry & Confectionary – The History</h1>
            <p> Everything started with the desire to serve something sweet after a meal and it evolved into the decadent world we know today. Fruits and cheese were not enough for the French people so a new type of art –
                the art of pastries and confectionaries – was born and a whole new world of cakes, pastries, and delicious confectionaries has come to life.
                In 1270 when Régnaut-Barbon decided he wants to make oublies (confectioners’ ancestors) and pastries. And from there, everything started to develop and to grow into the amazing industry that French pastry and confectionary is today.
